# react-use-svg
NPM library to encapsule the way to renderize svg in HTML. 

Not all [browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use#Browser_compatibility) has compatibility with `href` of `<use>` element, and `xlink:href` is deprecated. So, for this reason the library was created.
